# Data-Cleaning-Assignment Coursera
This repo was created by me for the peer Graded Assignment of the course "Getting and Cleaning" of the "Data Science" track. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

To reviewers: I missed the part where it said we would only need to focus on the mean variables. So I did them all. Oops! (Even the raw data of the accelerometer and gyroscope, which I stored in a seperate data frame.) Oh well. :)

The "run_analysis.R" file contains R code to tidy the data set found here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip describes the variables that result after running the "run_analysis.R".

Simply run the "run_analysis.R" file. It will download the data if it is not found in the same map. Then it will read all the data and store it in two data frames. "Codebook.md" contains information about the the two data frames and explainations on all the columns of those data frames.
